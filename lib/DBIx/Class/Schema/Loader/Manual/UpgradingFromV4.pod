DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::Manual::UpgradingFromV4 - Important Information
Related to Upgrading from Version 0.04006

=head1 What Changed

=over 4

=item *

add_column

The new Loader detects much more information about columns and sets flags like
C<is_auto_increment> that it didn't set before.

=item *

RelBuilder

The new RelBuilder will give you nicer accessor names for relationships, so you
will no longer have conflicts between a foreign key column and the relationship
accessor itself (if the FK is named C<_id>.)

It will also more correctly infer the relationship type, e.g. some relationships
that were previously detected as a C<has_many> will now be a C<might_have>
(when it detects a unique constraint on the foreign key column.)

=item *

moniker_map

Table names are now singularized when determining the C<Result> class names. So
the table C<user_roles> would have become C<UserRoles> in C<0.04006> but now
becomes C<UserRole> instead.

=item *

Support for more databases

We now support Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase, and there are also improvements
to the other backends.

=back

=head1 Backward Compatibility

In backward compatibility mode, the Loader will use the old relationship names
and types, and will not singularize monikers for tables.

To control this behavior see L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::Base/naming>.

=head2 Static Schemas

When reading a C<Schema.pm> from a static schema generated with an C<0.04>
version of Loader, backward compatibility mode will default to on, unless
overridden with the C<naming> attribute.

=head2 Dynamic Schemas

Dynamic schemas will always by default use C<0.04006> mode.

To upgrade a dynamic schema, set the naming attribute (which is proxied to the
loader) in your C<Schema.pm>:

    __PACKAGE__->naming('current');
