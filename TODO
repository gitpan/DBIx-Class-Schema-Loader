SQLite needs some heavy refactoring, the subroutines are becoming too complex to understand easily.

Consider:
   If local column is UNIQUE or PK, use has_one() for relation?
   Re-scan relations/tables after initial relation setup to find ->many_to_many() relations to be set up?
   Check NULLability of columns involved in the relationship, which might suggest a more optimal non-default -join-type?
